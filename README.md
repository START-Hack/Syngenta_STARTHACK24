## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

**What is the current problem?**

As the world’s population increases, farmers are under huge pressure to grow more food from the same amount of land. At the same time, there is a need to increase the sustainability of our food systems whilst ensuring the increased demand is met.  

Farmers have to constantly make decisions which involve trade-offs between factors such as yield, cost, CO2 emissions and other sustainability metrics. The impacts of these decisions and trade-offs involved are often poorly understood by policymakers and the general public.  

**What is the expected final product?**

Using satellite imagery, weather and other datasets from real farms, build a gamified solution to illustrate the impact of different farm decisions (such as what crop to plant, whether to till the soil, how much fertilizer to apply) on agricultural and sustainability outcomes 

The solution can take various forms: an app, website, or online game, etc.  

**Who are the users of this solution?**

Food consumers (the general public), policymakers and educators 

Optionally: Farmers, ag retailers, agronomists etc. in ‘expert mode’

Syngenta will provide access to data from real commercial farms, access to satellite imagery, weather and environmental datasets, and pest and disease models. A description of each dataset/API and how to use it will be provided in the Github folder.  

Hackers will have to API access to three Syngenta platforms: 
- Cropwise Imagery: a platform for sourcing satellite imagery from satellites such as Sentinel, LandSat and Planet Labs. In addition to sourcing raw imagery, Cropwise Imagery also enables users to run analysis and post-processing models  
- CE Hub: a data lake for crop and environmental datasets 
- Insights Engine: access to a variety of crop, pest and disease models 

Hackers are invited to use programming software such as Python and any other tools at their disposal to tackle the case  

Participants are welcome to use any other publicly available datasets
