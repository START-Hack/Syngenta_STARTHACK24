## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

**What is the current problem?**

As the world’s population increases, farmers are under huge pressure to grow more food from the same amount of land. At the same time, there is a need to increase the sustainability of our food systems whilst ensuring the increased demand is met.  

Farmers have to constantly make decisions which involve trade-offs between factors such as yield, cost, CO2 emissions and other sustainability metrics. The impacts of these decisions and trade-offs involved are often poorly understood by policymakers and the general public.  

**What is the expected final product?**

Using satellite imagery, weather and other datasets from real farms, build a gamified solution to illustrate the impact of different farm decisions (such as what crop to plant, whether to till the soil, how much fertilizer to apply) on agricultural and sustainability outcomes 

The solution can take various forms: an app, website, or online game, etc.  

**Who are the users of this solution?**

Food consumers (the general public), policymakers and educators 

Optionally: Farmers, ag retailers, agronomists etc. in ‘expert mode’

## <p align="center"> Further Information: </p>

Syngenta will provide access to data from real commercial farms, access to satellite imagery, weather and environmental datasets, and pest and disease models. A description of each dataset/API and how to use it will be provided in the Github folder.  

Hackers will have to API access to three Syngenta platforms: 
- Cropwise Imagery: a platform for sourcing satellite imagery from satellites such as Sentinel, LandSat and Planet Labs. In addition to sourcing raw imagery, Cropwise Imagery also enables users to run analysis and post-processing models  
- CE Hub: a data lake for crop and environmental datasets 
- Insights Engine: access to a variety of crop, pest and disease models 

Hackers are invited to use programming software such as Python and any other tools at their disposal to tackle the case  

Participants are welcome to use any other publicly available datasets    


##  <p align="center"> Resources: </p>
Below is an overview of the tools that you may use during the hack:

- **Cropwise Imagery**: Provides advanced satellite and aerial imaging to monitor crop health. By utilizing the Imagery application or the Remote Sensing API, growers can leverage specialized analytics to detect variations in the field that are invisible to the naked eye. This provides insights into crop vigor and helps identify issues early on, enabling more informed agronomic decisions.​

- **CE-Hub**: Provides a central access point for environmental data associated with time and geographical coordinates. Through well-defined APIs, it is possible to obtain historical weather data, vegetation health information, soil characteristics, land use, and topography.​ [Documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CEHub%20API%20Service%20Specification.docx), [API Postman Collection](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/CE%20Hub%20API's.postman_collection.json), [Swagger API Documentation](https://services.cehub.syngenta-ais.com/swagger/index.html) and [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/ce%20hub/GMT20240319-133726_Recording_1920x1080.mp4)

- **Insights Engine**: Applies advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret weather patterns, soil conditions, crop health information, and satellite imagery. This assists growers in making more informed decisions about their farming practices.​ The Insights Engine API offers predictions on the optimal planting times, recommendations for fertilizers or pesticides, and early warnings for potential issues.[Documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/insights%20engine/Insights%20Engine%20API%20Service%20Specification%20v3.0.docx), [API Postman Collection](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/insights%20engine/IE_model_APIs.postman_collectionv3.json), [API Swagger Documentation](https://docs.api.insights.cropwise.com/#tag/Computational-Agronomy) and [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/blob/main/docs/api/insights%20engine/GMT20240319-080707_Recording_1920x1080.mp4); 

You are also welcome to use any other public dataset that consider relevant for the success of your project. 

Onboarding process: 
1. Your team will be allocated a specific group number. Please, nominate a person from your team to come to our booth at the beginning of the Hack in order to get the group number for your team. You will also receive at that time a specific API token to access the CEHub API.

2. To initiate the onboarding process, please use our [onboarding tool](https://syngenta.github.io/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/) to officially register your team; ensure you select the correct group number designated to you.

3. Upon registration, each team member will receive a welcome email that includes instructions for accessing their Syngenta Cropwise Account.
  
5. Within your account, you can proceed to create your virtual farm and fields using the [Farm Settings](https://app.cropwise.com/app/) application, tailoring it to your team’s specifications.

6. Once your farm setup is complete, you will have the opportunity to utilize the suite of Cropwise applications, including [Cropwise Imagery](https://imagery.cropwise.com/), or use advanced API tools such as Remote Sensing, CE-Hub, or Insights Engine to build your project.

7. Our main documentation hub is located at [Cropwise Hackathon Guide](https://syngenta.github.io/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024/guide.html). On this landing page, you’ll get access to the [API documentation](https://github.com/syngenta/syngenta-start-global-hackathon-2024), as well as direct links to the [Cropwise Imagery application](https://imagery.cropwise.com/). Additionally, the guide elaborates on various image analysis tools at your disposal. We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with these materials to maximize your readiness for the hackathon.
